# 🧠 Machine Learning Practice Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the implementation of various Machine Learning algorithms. These notebooks are created for hands-on learning, experimentation, and understanding core concepts of ML.

## 📚 Contents

Each notebook demonstrates one or more machine learning algorithms with explanations, code, and visualizations (where applicable).

### 🔍 Supervised Learning

- 📈 **Linear Regression** – Predicting continuous values
- 🌳 **Decision Trees**
- 🧱 **Random Forest**
- 📬 **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification
- 🎯 **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- 🧠 **Neural Networks (using `sklearn` or `keras`)**
- 🕵️ **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- 👥 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

- 🧩 **K-Means Clustering**
- 📊 **Hierarchical Clustering**
- 📉 **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Dimensionality reduction

### 🛠️ Utilities

- 📊 Data Preprocessing (scaling, encoding, missing value handling)
- 📉 Model Evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- 🧪 Cross-Validation
- 📈 Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
